:summary: My first time participating in Advent of Code.

This was the first time I attempted `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/2021>`_.
In a nutshell, Advent of Code is a website that offers a daily programming puzzle during the month of December.
The puzzles are holiday-themed and are a fun, silly way to brush up on algorithms and data structures.
The puzzles increase in complexity each day and can become time-consuming. My attempts are in 
`this github repo <https://github.com/ariesunique/advent-of-code>`_.
I'm happy with my overall progress and look forward to playing again next year!
