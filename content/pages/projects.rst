:lead:`This is a list of some projects I have worked on for my own personal learning.
Some of these were more successful than others.`

**Corpus Tool**

Corpus Collection Tool `description <../corpus-tool.html>`_ and `live demo <https://corpus-aunique.herokuapp.com>`_ -
This was a prototype to enable faculty to create a corpus of student writing.

|

**Attendance Tool**

`SPELL Attendance Tracker <../attendance-tracker.html>`_ -
This was my first attempt at creating a Flask application. The goal was to create
an online attendance tracking tool that could be used by teachers to store and monitor
student attendance.

**Word Counter**

I followed along with a Flask `tutorial <https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/Flask/Python_Flask_App_1_Word_Count_Postgres_SQLAlchemy.php>`_ and created this nifty little web application.
You can `view screenshots here <../site-word-counter.html>`_, or `see it live here <https://wordcount-stage-aunique.herokuapp.com/>`_.
