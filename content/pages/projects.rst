This is a list of some projects I have worked on for my own personal learning.
Some of these were more successful than others.

**Corpus Tool**

`Corpus Collection Tool <https://corpus-aunique.herokuapp.com>`_

**Attendance Tool**

`SPELL Attendance Tracker <../attendance-tracker.html>`_ -
This was my first attempt at creating a Flask application. The goal was to create
an online attendance tracking tool that could be used by teachers to store and monitor
student attendance.
