Here's some stuff `about me`_.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks for visiting my page! For 10 years, I worked as a software engineer for large companies such as Citigroup and The New York Times. During that time, I primarily used Java and J2EE. 

When my oldest daughter was born, I decided to stay home with her, while also using the time to pursue other interests. In 2016, I completed a Masters in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and began teaching English to adults in community and academic programs. During this time, I also began teaching myself Python and completely fell in love with the language. 

Currently, I teach English part-time and freelance on python projects. I'm very interested in Natural Language Processing as it is a natural bridge between my interest in language and my love of programming.



How I built `this blog`_
