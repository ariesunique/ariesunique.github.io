:summary: For the past 6 weeks, I have been part of an amazing program called the Recurse Center. In this post, I share a little bit about what the Recurse Center is, how it works, and why it is a wonderful opportunity for anyone who is excited about technology.

*******************************
WHAT IS THE RECURSE CENTER?
*******************************

- It is *NOT* a school 
- It is *NOT* a bootcamp
- It is *NOT* an internship or apprenticeship
- There are no teachers, classes, tests, midterms, assignments, or deadlines [#]_
- There are no bosses, supervisors, managers, evaluations, or performance reviews

:lead:`"The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City."`

:text-warning:`Let's break that definition down a bit`
=========================================================

**self-directed**
------------------

At the Recurse Center, people decide for themselves how they want to spend their time. 
Attendees (called Recursers) choose *what* to work on, *when* to work, and for *how long*. 
Recursers decide *for themselves* when a project has reached completion. 
Recrusers decide when their *personal objectives* have been met. 

**community-driven**
----------------------

All of the activites that occur at the Recurse Center (RC) are initiated, coordinated, and facilitated by attendees of the retreat. Any recurser is welcome to create a new event for the community. 


**educational-retreat**
-------------------------

Everyone at Recurse is there because they want to learn. Recursers set their own syllabus and milestones. They can choose to work with others or to work independently.

*********************************************
WHY ATTEND THE RECURSE CENTER?
*********************************************

Recursers attend for various reasons. 

- Unlike a bootcamp, school, internship, or other structured program, Recurse gives attendess to freedom to pursue their own interests
- Some Recursers attend to work on a specific project
- Some Recursers attend to get inspired for an idea for their next project
- Many recursers look forward to finding other developers excited about technology *[x]*

:lead:`I attended the Recurse Center because I wanted to be around other people excited about technology, I wanted to learn more about web development and data analystics using python, and I wanted to get back into the habit of coding daily.`

.. [#] In actuality, everyone at Recurse is both a teacher and a student. We are all experts at something and beginners at something else.
